# Roadmap
`rss-proxy` is a POC with great potential. Here are some thoughts on what could be done.

## Issues/Ideas
- publishedDate from meta tags )deep), else current date and pushed to remote
- updatedDate cannot be constructed
- Extract dates from content
- proxy should prefere a native feed provided by the site, iff no rule is defined
- probably integrate puppeteer preprosessing to support dynamic sites
- ask michal to test it
- add quality scores/quantity measures to items to facilitate filtering (e.g. shareCount from social media platforms from client to remote)

## Monetization For Commercial use
- All need API key to use the "deep content" feature
